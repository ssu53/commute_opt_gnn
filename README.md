# Commute-time-optimal graphs for GNNs

## Generating Cayley Graphs

```python
V = 40 # The number of vertices of the input graph

generator = CayleyGraphGenerator(V) # Instantiate the Cayley graph generator by computing the size of the smallest Cayley graph with at least V nodes
generator.generate_cayley_graph() # Generate the Cayley graph
generator.trim_graph() # Trim the Graph with BFS to have V nodes again
generator.visualize_graph() # Visualize the graph (optional trimmed=False to see graph before trimming)
```
